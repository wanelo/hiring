  <h2><b>Engineering at Wanelo</b></h2>

  <div style="font-size:13pt; text-align: justify;">

    <p>
      Think of Wanelo as a mall on your phone, curated by people just like you. It helps you find the most amazing
      products in the universe. A regular mall has 150 stores, but on Wanelo you'll find over 550,000 stores which
      include all the big brands you know, as well as tiny independent boutiques and sellers you've never heard of.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wanelo ("wah-nee-loh," from Want, Need, Love) is also a way to search and follow all of your favorite stores in
      one place. It's used by millions of people who post tens of thousands of new products to Wanelo every day. </p>

    <p>
      Wanelo was launched in 2012 and is based in San Francisco, California, on the western coast of the North American
      continent on the beautiful planet Earth.
    </p>

    <p>
    We have two engineering positions available:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>True</em> full-stack engineers. Someone who has familiarity from server automation and writing bash scripts all the way to the user interface. Most of the code written for this job will be in Ruby.</li>
      <li>iOS Engineers. Our application is 100% Obj-C currently, so experience with that is a must.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We're looking for people with at least a year of relevant experience for the position, but we also value people who learn quickly.  We're into TDD, pairing, and CI, with the understanding that these are just tools for the job and not the be-all and end-all. We value our lives over work (we work from 10am-7pm every day, but timing is flexible), but we love our jobs and the people we work with. We're looking for someone who likes to get stuff done, go for afternoon feelings walks (coffee + sunshine), and join in lunchtime debates about the merits of tacos (hint: they are delicious).</p>

    <p>Let's talk!</p>
